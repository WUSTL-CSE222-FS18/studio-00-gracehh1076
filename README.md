# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

They use markdown to highlight words in the text, as well as to make text both bold and italicized.

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***

1. Ice cream
2. Strawberries
3. Stir fry
  1. Rice
  1. Carrots
  1. Baby corn
  1. Edamame
  1. Teriyaki Sauce
4. Pasta
5. Quesadillas
  * Tortilla
  * Rice
  * Beans

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

### My heading.

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```Java
   for(int g = 0; g < 11; ++g) {
    System.out.print(g);
   }
   ```


## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

Name | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Connected | Staying compatible with surrounding networks
Sensing | Create an experience that feels like the real world
Smart | Knowing user's needs
Safety | Keeping users safe and reminding them of safe habits

Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. Nest Thermostat
  1.  [Link](https://www.channelfutures.com/channel-futures/nest-thermostat-troubles-problems-iot-and-smart-devices-exemplified)
  1. The Nest Thermostat helps users save energy by automatically adjusting the temperature inside their home based on the weather and whether or not the user is home.
  1. It is connected through Wifi. The Nest also senses the user's preferred temperature, making it both sensing and smart. The Nest also reminds users of safe habits by turning off unnecessary air conditioning and heating.
1. WeMo Switch Smart Plug
  1. [Link](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/wemo-smart-switch-recipes/)
  1. The WeMo Switch Smart Plug helps makes user's homes more energy efficient, thus saving them money.
  1. The plug is connected through a normal power outlet. It also senses the user's normal energy use and tracks that. This feature makes it a smart plug because it is aware of the user's needs and will turn on and off according to those. It also reminds users of safe energy habits by saving energy once a device is fully charged.


## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

1. Vishesh Patel
1. Vishesh talked about how widespread IOT devices are and how quickly they are expanding.

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***

1. Jessica Thoelke
1. Jess mentioned how many of the products aim to be efficient and take the work away from the user.
